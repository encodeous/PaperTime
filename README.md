# PaperTime

PaperTime is a specialized Paper fork that enables technical players to manipulate the game speed.

Version: `1.19.3` as of now.

The fork's functionality can be accessed through the command `/stps` (with the permission node of `bukkit.command.stps`)

## Features
- Use `/stps <tps>` to set the game's tick speed
- Pause all world/chunk ticks by setting `/stps 0`
- Step through ticks individually by using `/stps add <ticks>`

## Setup

Download the `paperclip.jar` from the releases.

The setup is the same as any normal paper server.
